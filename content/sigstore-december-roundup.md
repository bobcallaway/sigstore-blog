‚Äú*And lo, in the land of software package management, a system was born to bring order and trust. Sigstore was its name, and its mission was to sign packages with short-lived certificates, validated by a powerful OIDC provider. These signed packages were then placed in a transparency database for all to see, like a holy book open for all to read and verify. Sigstore was a beacon of hope in a chaotic world, shining brightly as a protector of software integrity.*‚Äù
