We started the [Sigstore](http://sigstore.dev/) project with a goal of making key management, certificates, and digital signatures accessible and easy to use for every developer and language community. It’s incredibly exciting to see our tooling and services used by new ecosystems, so we were thrilled to see the [recent RFC](https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/pull/37) from Shopify around improving the signing mechanisms on [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) using Sigstore.

On behalf of the Sigstore community, we’d like to affirm that we’re here to help with this RFC in any way we can! We’re happy to make changes to Sigstore itself, or to collaborate on whichever new tools, services, or libraries are needed to make this effort successful.

Signed (get it?),
