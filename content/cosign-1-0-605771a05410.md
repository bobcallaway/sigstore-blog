For the initial release we plan on supporting:
\* Signing images with KMS (GCP, AWS, Azure, Vault), YubiKeys, and locally stored keys
\* Verifying image signatures using the same, plus public keys specified by URL
\* Verifying images in Dockerfiles
\* Uploading & signing arbitrary blobs (and [📄✍🏻👨🏻‍🦳 ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)[🇺🇸](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)[*SBOMs*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/)[🦅](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/))
\* Stable APIs in `pkg/` for integrating Cosign into build systems and policy engines

Additionally, we’re shipping with some exciting endgame features that are available on an experimental/unstable basis:
\* [Fulcio](https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio) root CA and [Rekor](https://github.com/sigstore/rekor) transparency log integration
\* [“Keyless” signing](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/KEYLESS.md) tied to OIDC identity

We’re seeking community feedback on the [current UX](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/USAGE.md), [signature spec](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/specs/SIGNATURE_SPEC.md), feature requests and ecosystem integrations, and any showstopping issues you may encounter.
